    <main>
        <p>Welcome to The Core Workshop. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our service.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any personal information directly from you. When you use our service through the Pi Browser and choose to submit a project, we use the Pi SDK to access the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pi User ID (UID):</strong> A unique identifier for your Pi account.</li>
            <li><strong>Pi Username:</strong> The username associated with your Pi account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect or store your email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The Pi User ID and Username are used solely for the purpose of attributing the projects you submit to your Pi account. This allows the community to see who created a particular project.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our app uses Firebase for its database. This service stores the project data and your Pi User ID and Username to power the app's functionality.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the Pi Browser's in-app chat.</p>
